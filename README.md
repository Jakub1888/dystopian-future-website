This is my first created website which also serves as portfolio showcasing all of the coding technologies that I learned so far as a self-taught web designer.

Technologies used here are HTML, SCSS and little bit of jQuery.

Content of the website is focused on the portrayal of Dystopian fiction in the popular culture where I picked a well-known Movie, Book, Video Game and Music genre 
with Dystopian thematic and put them into small sections on the website.
